### Why?

Over time, you get a bunch of web pages - institutions, your own, Google scholar, blogs, courses, etc. *And it's impossible to keep them all recent.* 

This website is a directory to keep track of all the links and which ones are up to date or not. **I just need to remember to update it**.
